## Package overview
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
library(here)
knitr::include_graphics("extras/OmopPopEpi_overview.png")
```

OmopPopEpi contains functions for estimating population-level incidence and prevalence using the OMOP common data model. The package facilitates the creation of the denominator populations for incidence and prevalence calculations with the collect_denominator_pops() function. Prevalence and inncidence can then be calculated for a set of (previously instanstiated) outcome cohorts, using the collect_pop_prevalence() and collect_pop_incidence() functions. The obscure_counts_prevalence() and obscure_counts_incidence() can then be used to enforce minimum cell counts that may be required before results can be shared. 

## Results specification
The results prdoduced are as follows:
