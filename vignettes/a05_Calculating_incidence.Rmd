# Introduction
Incidence rates describe the rate at which new events occur in a population, with the denominator the person-time at risk of the event during this period. In the previous vignettes we have seen how we can identify a set of denominator and outcome cohorts. Incidence rates can then be calculated using time contributed from these denominator cohorts up to their entry into an outcome cohort.

There are a number of options to consider when calculating incidence rates. This package accommodates two main parameters, including:

1. **Outcome washout**: The number of days used for a 'washout' period between the end of one outcome ending and an individual starting to contribute time at risk again.
2. **Repeated events**: Whether individuals are able to contribute multiple events during the study period or if they will only contribute time up to their first event during the study period.

### No washout, no repetitive events
In this example there is no outcome washout specified and repetitive events are not allowed, so individuals contribute time up to their first event during the study period.
```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/inc_no_rep_no_washout.png"))
```

### Washout all history, no repetitive events
In this example the outcome washout is all history and repetitive events are not allowed. As before individuals contribute time up to their first event during the study period, but having an outcome prior to the study period (such as person "3") means that no time at risk is contributed.

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/inc_no_rep_washout_all.png"))
```

### Some washout, no repetitive events
In this example there is some amount of outcome washout and repetitive events are not allowed. As before individuals contribute time up to their first event during the study period, but having an outcome prior to the study period (such as person "3") means that time at risk is only contributed once sufficient time has passed for the outcome washout criteria to have been satisfied.

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/inc_no_rep_some_washout.png"))
```

### Some washout, repetitive events
Now repetitive events are allowed with some amount of outcome washout specified. So individuals contribute time up to their first event during the study period, and then after passing the outcome washout requirement they begin to contribute time at risk again.

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/inc_rep_some_washout.png"))
```

# Outcome definition
General information on how to define outcome cohorts can be found in the vignette "Creating outcome cohorts". The most important recommendations for defining an outcome cohort for calculating incidence are:

1. Do not restrict outcome cohorts to first events only. This will impact the ability to exclude participants (as they can be excluded based on the prior latest event) and to capture more than one event per person (which is an option allowed in the package).
2. Set an appropriate cohort exit strategy. If you want to be able to capture more than one event per person, it is important to set the event persistence to a fixed duration relative to the event and not to the end of observation.
3. Do not add further restrictions on sex, age and prior history requirements. These can be specified when identifying the denominator population with the `generateDenominatorCohortSet()` function.

Considering all the above, we only recommend restricting outcome definitions to first events if the user is not interested in further occurrences and if all prior history is considered to exclude participants who have already experienced the event.


# Using estimateIncidence()
`estimateIncidence()` is the function we use to estimate incidence rates. To demonstrate its use, let´s load the IncidencePrevalence package (along with a couple of packages to help for subsequent plots) and generate 50,000 example patients using the `mockIncidencePrevalenceRef()` function, from whom we´ll create a denominator population without adding any restrictions other than a study period.

```{r setup}
library(IncidencePrevalence)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

cdm <- mockIncidencePrevalenceRef(
  sampleSize = 50000,
  outPre = 0.5
)

cdm$denominator <- generateDenominatorCohortSet(
  cdm = cdm,
  startDate = as.Date("2008-01-01"),
  endDate = as.Date("2012-01-01"),
  ageGroup = list(c(0, 150)),
  sex = "Both",
  daysPriorHistory = 0
)

cdm$denominator %>%
  glimpse()
```


Let´s first calculate incidence rates on a yearly basis, without allowing repetitive events
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inc <- estimateIncidence(
  cdm = cdm,
  denominatorTable = "denominator",
  outcomeTable = "outcome",
  interval = "years",
  outcomeWashout = 0,
  repeatedEvents = FALSE
)

inc %>%
  glimpse()

inc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incidence_start_date, y = incidence_100000_pys,
             ymin = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_lower,
             ymax = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_upper)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Now with a washout of all prior history while still not allowing repetitive events
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inc <- estimateIncidence(
  cdm = cdm,
  denominatorTable = "denominator",
  outcomeTable = "outcome",
  interval = "years",
  outcomeWashout = NULL,
  repeatedEvents = FALSE
)

inc %>%
  glimpse()

inc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incidence_start_date, y = incidence_100000_pys,
             ymin = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_lower,
             ymax = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_upper)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Now we´ll set the washout to 180 days while still not allowing repetitive events
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inc <- estimateIncidence(
  cdm = cdm,
  denominatorTable = "denominator",
  outcomeTable = "outcome",
  interval = "years",
  outcomeWashout = 180,
  repeatedEvents = FALSE
)

inc %>%
  glimpse()

inc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incidence_start_date, y = incidence_100000_pys,
             ymin = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_lower,
             ymax = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_upper)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

And finally we´ll set the washout to 180 days and allow repetitive events
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inc <- estimateIncidence(
  cdm = cdm,
  denominatorTable = "denominator",
  outcomeTable = "outcome",
  interval = "years",
  outcomeWashout = 180,
  repeatedEvents = TRUE
)

inc %>%
  glimpse()

inc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incidence_start_date, y = incidence_100000_pys,
             ymin = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_lower,
             ymax = incidence_100000_pys_95CI_upper)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_minimal()
```


### Other parameters
In the examples above, we have used calculated incidence rates by months and years, but it can be also calculated by weeks, months, quarters, or for the entire study time period. In addition, we can decide whether to include time intervals that are not fully captured in the database (e.g., having data up to June for the last study year when computing yearly incidence rates). By default, incidence will only be estimated for those intervals where the database captures all the interval (completeDatabaseIntervals=TRUE).

Given that we can set `estimateIncidence()` to exclude individuals based on other parameters (e.g., outcomeWashout), it is important to note that the denominator population used to compute incidence rates might differ from the one calculated with `generateDenominatorCohortSet()`.

The user can also set the minimum number of events to be reported, below which results will be obscured. By default, results with <5 occurrences are blinded, but if minCellCount=0, all results will be reported. 95 % confidence intervals are calculated using the exact method. We can set verbose=TRUE to report progress as code is running. By default, no progress is reported (verbose=FALSE). 

```{r, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
inc <- estimateIncidence(
  cdm = cdm,
  denominatorTable = "denominator",
  outcomeTable = "outcome",
  interval = c("weeks"),
  completeDatabaseIntervals = FALSE,
  outcomeWashout = 180,
  repeatedEvents = TRUE,
  minCellCount = 0,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

### Output
`estimateIncidence()` will generate a table with incidence rates for each of the time intervals studied and for each combination of the parameters set. Similar to the output obtained by `generateDenominatorCohortSet()`, the table generated will also be associated with attributes such as settings and attrition.

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inc <- estimateIncidence(
  cdm = cdm,
  denominatorTable = "denominator",
  outcomeTable = "outcome",
  interval = c("Years"),
  outcomeWashout = c(0, 180),
  repeatedEvents = TRUE,
  returnParticipants = TRUE
)
attrition(inc)
settings(inc)
```

In addition, if we set returnParticipants as TRUE as above, we can see the individuals who contributed to a given analysis by using `participants()`. This can be used if we want to perform further analyses on the individuals (e.g. describing their characteristics).
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
participants(inc)
```

We can find the median year of cohort entry of those people contributing to analysis 1 for example by
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
participants(inc, analysisId = 1) %>%
  summarise(median_start = median(year(cohort_start_date)))
```
